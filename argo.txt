I'm getting an argo sync error
I think its because I haven't updated this yaml since I forked it
I was going to move opsera and argo to a new branch for these experiments
  but the branch is specified in a few locations and I don't want to get bogged down


test 0 - first test is to move the yaml so that the app can't find it.. lets see if the error changes

looks like I got the same thing.. ComparisonError: unknown;ComparisonError: unknown
